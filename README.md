# Judge0 Deployment for Octaview SaaS

This repository contains a **self-hosted Judge0** instance deployed on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. Judge0 is an open-source **online code execution system** that powers **Octaview's** coding assessments and interview automation.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Supports multiple programming languages
- Secure and isolated code execution
- **Redis queue-based job processing** for efficient execution
- **PostgreSQL** support for persistent data storage
- Scalable deployment on **GCP Compute Engine**
- Integrated into **Octaview B2B SaaS** for real-time evaluations

---

## üìå Deployment Setup

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

```sh
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI)
- A running GCP Compute Engine instance
- Redis for queuing execution requests
- PostgreSQL for persistent data
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mammenmathewz/judge0-octaview.git  
cd judge0-octaview  
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file and configure necessary variables:

```sh
JUDGE0_TELEMETRY_ENABLE=false  # Disable telemetry  
REDIS_HOST=localhost  
REDIS_PORT=6379  
POSTGRES_USER=judge0  
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword  
POSTGRES_DB=judge0  
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Start Judge0 with Docker

```sh
docker-compose up -d  
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Verify the Deployment

After deployment, check if Judge0 is running:

```sh
curl http://localhost:2358/languages  
```

Expected Output:

```json
[
  {"id": 1, "name": "C (GCC 9.2.0)", "version": "9.2.0"},
  {"id": 2, "name": "C++ (GCC 9.2.0)", "version": "9.2.0"}
]
```

## ‚ö° API Usage

### üîπ Submit Code for Execution

```sh
curl -X POST "http://localhost:2358/submissions" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "language_id": 4,
           "source_code": "print(\"Hello, Octaview!\")",
           "stdin": ""
         }'
```

### üîπ Retrieve Execution Result

```sh
curl -X GET "http://localhost:2358/submissions/{TOKEN}"  
```

Replace `{TOKEN}` with the actual token received from the submission request.

---

## ‚ö° Redis-Based Job Queuing

Judge0 is configured to use **Redis** as a job queue for handling multiple execution requests asynchronously.

To monitor the Redis queue:

```sh
redis-cli monitor  
```

To check pending jobs:

```sh
redis-cli llen judge0_queue  
```

---

## üõ† Configuration

You can customize **Judge0** by modifying the `config` files in this repository.

For example, to adjust memory limits, update:

```sh
vi config/default.conf  
```

Change:

```sh
MAX_MEMORY=512MB  
MAX_TIME=10s  
```

---

## üì° Logging & Monitoring

To check logs:

```sh
docker logs -f judge0  
```

To view queued tasks in Redis:

```sh
redis-cli lrange judge0_queue 0 -1  
```

---

## üîí Security Notes

- **Firewall Rules**: Ensure your **GCP VM firewall** allows only necessary traffic.  
- **Sandboxing**: Execution is containerized to prevent security risks.  
- **Queue Protection**: Redis should be secured with authentication and firewall rules.
